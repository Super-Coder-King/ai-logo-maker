# Privacy Policy

LogoForge is designed with privacy as a foundational principle. This document explains how your data is handled.

## No Data Collection

- LogoForge **never** connects to the internet after installation unless you manually download updates.
- The application contains **no telemetry**, analytics, crash reporting, or hidden network calls.
- All prompts, designs, and project files are stored **only on your local machine**.

## Local Storage

By default, projects are saved to:
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\LogoForge`
- **macOS**: `~/Documents/LogoForge`
- **Linux**: `~/Documents/LogoForge`

These directories are never accessed by external services.

## Verification

You may:
- Inspect the source code (fully open)
